        <h3>Professional Summary</h3>
        <p>Problem-solving has always been a core part of my identity and the primary reason I chose tech as the primary focus of my career. My prior job experiences helped me obtain meaningful skills that can translate outside of those work environments. I learned how to manage my time efficiently to complete a variety of different tasks, learned how to tackle problems that arose through the troubleshooting of possible solutions, and learned how to collaborate with other team members on larger projects that required multiple workers. I have seen significant growth in my skillset as well as my character and know that these traits will be useful as I progress into my tech career.
